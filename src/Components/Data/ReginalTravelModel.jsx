                    For future traffic and land use projections, the NFRMPO uses two separate but related models: the 2010 Base Year Land Use Allocation Model (LUAM) and the 2015 Base Year Regional Travel Demand Model (RTDM). Both models forecast out to 2050 and can provide information for the following years: 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045, and 2050.
                </p>
                <p className='py-4'>The models were created using local input to estimate future growth in population, employment, travel patterns, and traffic volumes. Local agencies provided current land uses, future land uses, development data, traffic counts, and transportation projects. The models were reviewed by local agencies for each modelâ€™s base year and the 2050 forecast year to ensure reasonableness.</p>
                <p className='py-4'>The 2010 LUAM is built on the UrbanSim platform. The LUAM forecasts the location and timing of development and the resulting employment and household growth at the zonal level. The output information is then incorporated into the 2019 RTDM.</p>
