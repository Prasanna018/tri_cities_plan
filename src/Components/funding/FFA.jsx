                    (STBG) provides states and regions with flexible federal funding that may be used for a wide variety of highway and transit projects. Regional STBG funds are automatically sub allocated to regional planning organizations within the State. The wide variety of RSTGB investments in the Richmond Region support passenger and freight movement along the regionâ€™s surface transportation systems. The funds can be used to preserve and improve the conditions and performance on highways, bridges, tunnels, pedestrian facilities, bicycle infrastructure, and transit capital projects.
