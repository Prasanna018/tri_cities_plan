                <p>Given the recent formation of the TCAMPO in December 2023, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 UPWP is the TCAMPO’s first UPWP. It identifies work activities that will be performed between October 1, 2023, and September 30, 2024. The TCAMPO’s Draft FY24 UPWP was developed in 2023 in collaboration with TCAMPO member agencies, released for public comment in Spring 2024, and adopted by the TCAMPO Policy Board on June 12, 2024. The UPWP is updated for each fiscal year (October 1–September 30) and development of each UPWP begins in the Spring.</p>
